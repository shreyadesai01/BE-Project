Bachelor of Engineering Project. 

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments. The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
1.Ultrasonic Sensor Module
2.RF Modules
3.LDR
4.LED
5.IN4007
6.Resisters
7.Capacitors
8.Push Buttons

Working:
1. The provided code is first run on Arduino Software (IDE) which will help us to link the software to microcontroller. 
2. The microcontroller then processes this data and calculates if the obstacle is close enough. 
3. The software is designed in such a way that if the microcontroller does not detect an obstacle nearby it does nothing. If the microcontroller detects an object nearby it will sound a buzzer. It is also designed in a way to detect and sounds a different buzzer if it detects water and alerts the blind. 
4. One more feature is that it allows the blind to detect if there is light or darkness in the room.
5. The system has one more advanced feature integrated to help the blind find their stick if they forget where they kept it. A wireless rf based remote is used for this purpose. Pressing the remote button sounds a buzzer on the stick which helps the blind person to find their stick. 
6. Thus this system allows for obstacle detection as well as finding stick if misplaced by visually disabled people.
